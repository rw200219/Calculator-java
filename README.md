# Java Calculator

This is a simple Java calculator application developed using IntelliJ IDEA. It performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## Purpose

This project allowed me to utilise basic existing code to practice Java concepts that I have been learning. Over time, as I learn new concepts, I plan to add additional features to develop my skills further.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Handles division by zero with an error message
